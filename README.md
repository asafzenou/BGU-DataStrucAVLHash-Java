# BGU-DataStrucAVLHash-Java

Spring 2023 Introduction to Data Structures
This project contains the practical exercise solution for an Introduction to Data Structures course held in Spring 2023. The exercise focuses on Java familiarity, hash tables, and AVL trees.

Exercise Overview
The exercise aims to enhance understanding of hash tables, AVL trees, and their integration into a unified and efficient data structure.

Structure
The exercise is divided into two parts:

Hash Table with Double Hashing
Implementing a hash table with double hashing, storing spells and their incantations.
Hash Table with Chained AVL Trees
Developing a hash table with chaining, where each bucket contains an AVL tree representing spells of different categories.
Implementation Details
Detailed instructions and class specifications are provided in the document. Each part requires the implementation of specific classes and functions to ensure proper functionality.

AVL Trees
AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches. In this project, AVL trees are utilized to organize spells within hash table buckets, ensuring efficient retrieval and maintenance of the data structure.
