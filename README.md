Instructor: Tomer Meirman
Instructions:
The exercise submission starts from the following week (May 28) and has a dedicated submission space in the course's platform.
Only 5 submissions are allowed without grade deduction.
Collaboration or copying from other students or online sources is prohibited.
Usage of ChatGPT for code writing is not allowed.
Questions regarding the exercise should be asked on the course's forum or during office hours with Tomer Meirman.
Exercise Overview
The exercise aims to enhance understanding of hash tables, AVL trees, and their integration into a unified and efficient data structure.

Structure
The exercise is divided into two parts:

Hash Table with Double Hashing
Implementing a hash table with double hashing, storing spells and their incantations.
Hash Table with Chained AVL Trees
Developing a hash table with chaining, where each bucket contains an AVL tree representing spells of different categories.
Implementation Details
Detailed instructions and class specifications are provided in the document. Each part requires the implementation of specific classes and functions to ensure proper functionality.

AVL Trees
AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches. In this project, AVL trees are utilized to organize spells within hash table buckets, ensuring efficient retrieval and maintenance of the data structure.
